# Ambari CDAP Services

This is currently a work in progress.

It has been tested with Ambari 2.0 and HDP 2.2 release.

## Installation

Simply check out the repository on your Ambari server as described and restart Ambari. This
will check out the CDAP service using the latest release of CDAP. Specific versions of CDAP
can be gotten by pulling the corresponding branch. For example, for CDAP 3.1, you would
checkout the `release/3.1` branch.

```
git clone https://github.com/caskdata/ambari-cdap-stack.git /var/lib/ambari-server/resources/stacks/HDP/2.2/services/CDAP
git checkout release/3.1 # Optional
ambari-server restart
```
